          <h2>USA F-1 Visa (Student Visa)</h2>
          <p>
            The USA F-1 visa is a non-immigrant student visa that allows
            international students to pursue academic studies or language
            training programs at accredited U.S. institutions. It is the most
            common visa for those aiming to study in the United States.
            Applicants must be enrolled in a full-time program and demonstrate
            sufficient financial resources to cover their stay. The F-1 visa
            also permits limited on-campus employment and, post-graduation,
            offers opportunities for Optional Practical Training (OPT) in their
            field of study. This visa is a gateway for students to access
            world-class education and diverse cultural experiences in the U.S.
