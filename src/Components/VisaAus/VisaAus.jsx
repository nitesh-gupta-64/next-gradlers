          <h2>Australia Student Visa</h2>
          <p>
            The Australia student visa, subclass 500, allows international
            students to undertake full-time study at registered Australian
            educational institutions. Applicants must have an offer of
            enrollment, sufficient funds for tuition and living expenses, and
            Overseas Student Health Cover (OSHC). The visa permits work for up
            to 40 hours per fortnight during term and full-time during scheduled
            breaks. Australia's renowned education system, diverse culture, and
            excellent quality of life make it a top choice for international
            students seeking world-class education and career opportunities. The
            student visa is a pathway to enriching academic experiences and
            vibrant multiculturalism in Australia.
